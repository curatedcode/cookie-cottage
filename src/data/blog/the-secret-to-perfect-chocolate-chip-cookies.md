The perfect chocolate chip cookie strikes the right balance between crispy edges and a soft, gooey center. It’s not just about the chocolate—it’s the brown butter, the chill time, and the ratio of sugar to flour that brings everything together.

Many bakers overlook the importance of resting the dough. Allowing your cookie dough to rest for 24 hours deepens the flavor and enhances the texture. It gives the ingredients time to meld and creates a more complex, caramelized taste.

Experimenting with a mix of semi-sweet and dark chocolate chunks, along with flaky sea salt on top, can take your cookie game to the next level.
