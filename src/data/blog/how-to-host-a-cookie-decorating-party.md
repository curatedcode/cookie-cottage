Hosting a cookie decorating party is a great way to bring friends and family together for a fun, hands-on activity. Start by preparing plain sugar cookies in fun shapes and laying out a variety of colorful icings and sprinkles.

Be sure to set up stations with enough supplies and space for everyone. Include tools like piping bags, toothpicks for detail work, and edible glitter for extra sparkle.

To elevate the experience, provide aprons, themed decorations, and festive music. Donâ€™t forget take-home boxes so guests can proudly carry home their delicious creations.
