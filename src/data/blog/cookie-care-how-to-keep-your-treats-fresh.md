Proper storage is key to enjoying your cookies long after theyâ€™ve been baked. Keep them in an airtight container at room temperature to maintain their texture and taste.

For soft cookies, place a slice of bread in the container to retain moisture. For crispy ones, store them separately to preserve their crunch.

If freezing, use parchment paper between layers and thaw at room temperature to avoid sogginess. These small steps go a long way in preserving that fresh-baked magic.
