Baking gluten-free can be challenging, but with the right techniques and ingredients, you can create treats that everyone will love.

Start by using a blend of gluten-free flours like almond, rice, and tapioca flour to mimic the texture of traditional baked goods. Xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help replicate glutenâ€™s elasticity.

Be mindful of cross-contamination, especially if baking for those with celiac disease. Use separate utensils and prep areas to keep everything safe.
