							The Cookie Cottage began in January 2012, when Cathy VandeMheen, a
							former teacher, moved from Omaha to Sarasota and started a custom
							cookie business from her home. By June 2013, her love for baking,
							decorating, and working with children turned that hobby into a
							full-time career. Cathy is also an active member of the LEADS Club
							Florida — University Professional Women’s Chapter.
						</p>
						<p class="text-pretty">
							Today, The Cookie Cottage is a cozy, creative space nestled in
							Sarasota’s Historic Downtown Village, just off Fruitville Road and
							one block west of Washington Boulevard (Hwy 301). Each business in
							the Village is set in its own charming stand-alone cottage,
							offering a truly welcoming experience.
						</p>
						<p class="text-pretty">
							Join us for Fourth Fridays, when all the Village shops stay open
							from 5&ndash;9 p.m. It's a perfect evening to explore and enjoy
							our sweet little community.

					Cathy’s daughter recently shared a heartfelt look at how her mom’s
					path led to the creation of The Cookie Cottage in Sarasota, Florida...

						<span class="font-bold text-xl">&ldquo;</span>
						Stepping foot inside the Florida-based home of Cathy Vande Mheen, one
						would realize instantaneously that this unique, rambunctious woman has
						a very particular passion, not a past life on the opposite end of the
						spectrum. The first thing one might notice is the flour lightly dusting
						her granite countertops, or maybe a second glance is taken and the realization
						sets in of the scattered mixing bowls that are glazed with colored frosting.
						No matter where someone would turn or what kind of presumptions one would
						have, you can easily tell, through in and through out, that Cathy is
						a cookie connoisseur with a knack for decorating.
					</p>
					<p class="text-pretty">
						This brings us to the next topic: What kind of secret past does this
						woman have? For starters, it was one known to many but most likely
						never assumed by a stranger. It required patience, planning, and
						careful execution so as not to harm someone’s future. It was
						intricate work with tiring days and late nights. It was, as you may
						have guessed, a life of teaching.
					</p>
					<p class="text-pretty">
						Leading up to the creative frenzy of the baking life that Cathy now
						lives, she began the slow process that eventually got her to today.
						Back when she was deciding of what and who she wanted to become,
						never in her wildest dreams was she an owner of a cookie company. In
						fact, her ultimate goal was to become a teacher, something she
						achieved very early on in life. She made the executive decision as a
						second grader, mainly because of how nice her teacher had been, and
						stuck to the plan. It probably helped that the majority of her
						family was in the educational field as well, which ultimately pushed
						her in that direction.
					</p>

					<p class="text-pretty">
						Back in 2004, after years of being in the classroom, Cathy decided
						the school setting wasn’t suiting her wants and needs, so she
						started looking elsewhere for teaching jobs. Stumbling upon a very
						unique job, much like herself, she knew it was an offer she couldn’t
						refuse. The pay wasn’t the greatest, but how do you turn down a job
						at the Henry Doorly Zoo? You don’t, Cathy realized. She became the
						Camp Coordinator there for awhile, and would write curriculum for
						different programs in her spare time. Although Cathy had always been
						interested in baking, especially once her children were born, this
						was a crucial year for her. She took her first cookie decorating
						class, and that ultimately revved her up for the future. All she
						wanted to do from that point forward was teach kids how to decorate
						cookies. Luckily, being the camp coordinator, she was given the
						opportunity to make thematic cookies for birthday parties the zoo
						would host. Cathy absolutely loved it, but when the time came to
						move on to bigger and better things, cookie decorating still wasn’t
						on the list of potential careers, that is, until 2011 came along.
					</p>
					<p class="text-pretty">
						It all started out one day a few years ago as Cathy was headed to
						Florida for vacation. Being the talkative woman that she is, she
						struck up a conversation with a woman sitting next to her on the
						airplane, who happened to be going to meet her Realtor boyfriend
						down in Siesta Key, the final destination. The two got to discussing
						how great Florida was and eventually the conversation got Cathy to
						thinking. She realized there was so much more to life and went out
						on a limb, deciding to move to Florida with the help of her new
						realtor friend. From there, she attained her license to bake out of
						her home, and her new journey began with her first customer and
						friend. From there, she began the strenuous path down the road to
						the Cookie Cottage.
					</p>
					<p class="text-pretty">
						Taking a look back at Cathy’s kitchen and lifestyle, you would have
						never known that she was once a very calm, cool, and collected
						teacher. She definitely has the capabilities, but the cookie
						business is a very messy, fast-paced industry that she is
						single-handedly trying to dominate. This got me to wondering just
						how successful Florida was panning out to be. According to her,
						everything seems to be coming along quite nicely, contrary to what I
						believed. “The particular area I live in is booming with visitors.
						In fact, Siesta Key reported their best year ever in tourism.”
						Although walk-by traffic helps tremendously, it’s not enough to keep
						her head above water. For this reason, Cathy had to make a strong
						customer base, which is exactly what she did.
					</p>
					<p class="text-pretty">
						Today, I now stand in the kitchen of a locally renowned cookie
						decorator in the Siesta Key, Florida area. Business is really
						starting to pick up, mostly from the friendly faces around town and
						word of mouth from networking groups. Cathy can only hope that once
						her actual business, The Cookie Cottage, is opened by the end of the
						month, employees will be needed to help out with the rush of new
						clientele. Seeing as we’ve all been students, I’m sure everyone is
						pretty aware that a teacher has to wake up early, teach all day,
						stay after to help students, and ultimately take their work home
						with them. It is a very tiring job with long hours, but worth it in
						the eyes of a growing child. You’d think Cathy would have traded up
						in the aspect of less hours and less work, but as we all know, the
						cookies can’t make themselves. 6 a.m. wake up call, prepare cooking
						utensils, grab a cup of coffee, spend the day rolling and cutting
						out cookies, prepare frosting, clean up, get ready for the next day,
						done by 4. Just listening to the long days she has when baking
						stressed me out, so I asked how she handled it all. “It’s funny
						because I’ve always handled stress by baking. It helps me to
						concentrate, and sometimes it just helps me to stop thinking about
						everything else.”
					</p>
					<p class="text-pretty">
						Cathy has lived an adventurous life, but the real adventure is only
						beginning. As you can see from the two lives this remarkable woman
						has experienced, sometimes people are destined for greater things in
						their life than what they originally set out to do. Thankfully my
						mother, Cathy Vande Mheen, is one of the lucky few that was given
						the chance and is now making her way down that path.
